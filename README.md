# Portable Intruder Detector

## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:
This project focuses on creating an affordable, portable intrusion detection system specifically tailored for agricultural use. By combining advanced object detection, image processing with OpenCV, and machine learning technologies, this system detects potential threats in real-time with high accuracy. It distinguishes between different types of intruders, such as humans and animals, and provides farmers with immediate, targeted alerts through platforms like Telegram and SMS. Extensive testing has shown that the system is reliable, with 98.7% accuracy in detecting intruders under specific conditions, and an alarm activation time of just over 2 seconds.

### 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
📌 Advanced Object Detection and face recognition: Uses machine learning and deep learning for real-time identification of intruders.
📌 Real-Time Alerts: Sends immediate alerts to farmers via platforms like Telegram and SMS for swift action.
Intruder Detection: Distinguishing between humans and animals to help farmers respond appropriately.
📌 Animal Repellent Mechanism: Includes a feature to repel animal intruders, protecting crops and livestock.
📌 Scalable Design: Web application for monitoring and smart phone integration as camera sensor and alarm, adaptable to various farm sizes.
